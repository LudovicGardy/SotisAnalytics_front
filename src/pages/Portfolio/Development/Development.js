                Computer programming is an art, because it applies accumulated
                knowledge to the world, because it requires skill and ingenuity,
                and especially because it produces objects of beauty. A
                programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist will
                enjoy what he does and will do it better.

          I know well and which allows me to address broader issues by offering plug-and-play solutions, when necessary.
